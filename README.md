# odin-project-three
In this project, I will create a simple game in the web browser. The purpose of this project is to utilize the basic skills that have been developed so far and bring together HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single project. Although the curriculum doesn't require it, I'm going to use this project as an opportunity to familiarize myself with the JavaScript DOM API. Additionally, I would like to learn more about HTML Canvas and CSS animations.  If all goes well, this project should contain basic functionality for a game of rock-paper-scissors, a decent UI, and interesting animations using CSS and canvas.
