# odin-project-three
I built this project as part of a self-paced, online curriculum in web development. This is the third project in the sequence: an implementation of rock-paper-scissors. I used the project as an opportunity to familiarize myself with the JavaScript API for manipulating the DOM, the HTML5 canvas, and CSS animations. You may play the game [here](https://csvw.github.io/odin-project-three/).
